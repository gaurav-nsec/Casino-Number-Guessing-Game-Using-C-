I have created a casino no. Guessing game using C++ in which the user needs to input their total amount and choose the desired number they want to bid upon and the amount they want to bid. Using random function , the program will given any number, and if the number came is same as their bid number then they'll get the double amount they have bid, or else they lose that money and that process continues.
